            <p>It is <strong>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT</strong> for a brass player to have a solid warm up routine that covers key fundamental aspects of brass playing.</p>
            <p>You might hear stories of musicians like Freddie Hubbard that would not warm up. However, as Freddie demonstrated later in his career, this can lead to some SEVERE injuries. Here are the five main things you need to cover as a brass player when you first pick up your instrument everyday:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Long Tones</li>
            <li>Flexibility</li>
            <li>Range</li>   
            <li>Articulation</li>
            <li>Technique</li>
            </ul>

  <p><strong>Long tones</strong> are arguably the best thing you can possibly do to work on your sound. It sounds easy to do a long tone, but to actually get the most out of the exercise, you need to be very deliberate in how you approach this.</p>
  <p>I recommend varying your "attacks" when you do long tones. Try doing some breath attacks when you're first warming up so you create each note with the least amount of tension possible. I would also recommend doing the "spider approach" to your long tones practice. Try to hold the last note out for as long as you possibly can. Here are some different approaches you can try:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Breath attack > Tongue > Tongue</li>
  <li>Legato Tongue > Legato Tongue > Legato Tongue</li>

<section class="main-section" id="flexibility">
    <header>Flexibility</header>
    <article>
        <p><strong>Flexibility</strong> is what allows brass players to easily navigate wide intervals. I view it as the "stretching" part of my warm up after doing my long tones. It should be noted that doing too much flexibility can lead to injury. Be sure to limit this part of your warm up to 15 minutes at most. </p>
        <p>The key to really improving flexibility is to practice it slowly at first and gradually build until you can "lip trill." Here are a few different books to consider:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Schlossberg</li>
        <li>Arban</li>
        <li>Colin Lip Flexibilities</li>   
        </ul>

          <p>Playing in the upper register is arguably one of the most intimidating parts of playing a brass instrument, however, this can be gradually built in a very methodical manner.</p>
          <p>Whenever you practice in the upper register initially, I recommend playing as softly and slowly as you can! This will prevent you from injuring yourself and will give your chops a chance to get accustomed to playing in that register. Then when you feel comfortable, you can speed up the ecercise and introduce more volume. Here are just some examples of exercises I do daily that assist me:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Triads in the Upper Register</li>
          <li>Clarke Studies - Up the octave</li>
          <li>Long Tones in the Upper Register</li>   
          <li>Lip Trills in the Upper Register</li>
          </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="articulation">
        <header>Articulation</header>
        <article>
            <p><strong>Articulation</strong> can sometimes be the most difficult thing to practice without introducing tension. However, with slow and soft practice, this will quickly become as effortless as a breath attack.</p>
            <p>Be sure to practice staccato, legato, double, and triple tonguing EVERY DAY to maintain each different articulation. Here are just some exercises I utilize to work on my articulation:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Schlossberg</li>
            <li>Scales</li>
            <li>Arban</li>   
            <li>Clarke</li>
            <li>Concone Etudes</li>
            </ul>

          <article>
              <p><strong>Technique</strong> primarily deals with FINGER technique. I typically do these at the end of my warm up at a very soft volume to try and relax my embouchure as much as possible.</p>
              <p>Here are some exercises I utilize:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Clarke</li>
              <li>Scales</li>
              <li>Coker Patterns</li>   
              <li>Arpeggios</li>
              <li>Vizzutti Patterns</li>
              </ul>
